 <h1>M-Maybe</h1>
<h5><br>Dimensions: 152.4 cm × 152.4 cm
<br>Year: 1965
<br>Movement: Pop Art</h5>
<br>M-Maybe depicts a blonde attractive girl, which is typical of Lichtenstein's romance comics adaptations. As is a common theme among these works, she awaits a man in a vague but urban setting. The thought bubble reads "M–Maybe he became ill and couldn’t leave the studio". The text and her expression jointly capture her continuing worry and anticipation.</p>
