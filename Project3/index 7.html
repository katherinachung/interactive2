		<h5><br>Dimensions: 116.8 cm × 116.8 cm

	The porcelain enamel on steel measures 46 by 46 inches (116.8 cm × 116.8 cm).
	 It was adapted from a 1963 comic strip panel: Secret Hearts, no. 88 (June 1963), DC Comics.
	 It has been held at the Milwaukee Art Museum since 1965 and is considered to be one of Roy Lichtenstein's earliest attempts at producing enamel-on-steel works from the same type of comic-strip imagery he had already begun producing as conventional hand-painted canvases.</div>
